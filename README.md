# buildg: A tool to debug Dockerfile based on BuildKit

`buildg` is a tool to interactively debug Dockerfile based on [BuildKit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit).

- Source-level inspection
- Breakpoints and step execution
- Interactive shell on a step with your own debugigng tools
- Based on BuildKit (needs unmerged patches)
- Supports rootless

**early stage software** This is implemented based on BuildKit with some unmerged patches. We're planning to upstream them.

## How to use

```
buildg debug /path/to/build/context
```

To use your own image for debugging steps:

```
buildg debug --image=debugging-tools /path/to/build/context
```

### Exmaple

Debug the following Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
FROM busybox AS build1
RUN echo hello > /hello

FROM busybox AS build2
RUN echo hi > /hi

FROM scratch
COPY --from=build1 /hello /
COPY --from=build2 /hi /
```

Store this Dockerfile to somewhere (e.g. `/tmp/ctx/Dockerfile`) then run `buildg debug`.
`buildg.sh` can be used for rootless execution (discussed later).

```console
$ buildg.sh debug --image=ubuntu:22.04 /tmp/ctx

## Install

- Requirements
  - [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc)
  - [OPTIONAL] [RootlessKit](https://github.com/rootless-containers/rootlesskit) and [slirp4netns](https://github.com/rootless-containers/slirp4netns) for rootless execution

### Release binaries

Available from https://github.com/ktock/buildg/releases

### Building using make

Go 1.18+ is needed.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ktock/buildg
$ cd buildg
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

### Rootless mode

Install and use [`buildg.sh`](./extras/buildg.sh).
[RootlessKit](https://github.com/rootless-containers/rootlesskit) and [slirp4netns](https://github.com/rootless-containers/slirp4netns) are needed.

```
$ buildg.sh debug /tmp/mybuild
```

## Motivation

Debugging a large and complex Dockerfile isn't easy and can take a long time.
The goal of buildg is to solve it by providing a way to inspect the detailed execution state of a Dockerfile in an interactive and easy-to-use UI/UX.

BuildKit project has been working on better debugging support (e.g. https://github.com/moby/buildkit/pull/2813, https://github.com/moby/buildkit/issues/1472, https://github.com/moby/buildkit/issues/749).
Leveraging the generic features added through the work, this project implements a PoC for providing easy UI/UX to debug Dockerfile.

## Similar projects

- [`buildctl` by BuildKit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit) : has debug commands to inspect buildkitd, LLB, etc. but no interactive debugging for builds.
- [cntr](https://github.com/Mic92/cntr) : allows attaching and debugging containers but no interactive debugging for builds.
- [ctr by containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd) : allows directly controlling and inspecting containerd resources (e.g. contents, snapshots, etc.) but no interactive debugging for builds.
